# TimeSeries

  - So, the two most important differences between time series and regression are:
  
    - Time series have a strong temporal (time-based) dependence â€” each of these data sets essentially consists of a series of time stamped 
    observations, i.e., each observation is tied to a specific time instance. Thus, unlike regression, the order of the data is 
    important in a time series.
    
    - In a time series, you are not concerned with the causal relationship between the response and explanatory variable. 
    The cause behind the changes in the response variable is very much a black box.
    
  - Components
    - Predictable:
      - Local:
      - Global:
        - Trend
        - Seasonality
    - Un-predictable
      - Noise
